# ShmupRemix Process

## September 30, 2019: Brainstorming
To brainstorm different directions that my shmup could go, I listed off the primary characteristics of typical shoot-em-ups and Fullerton’s Formal Elements to see what I could change mechanically and thematically about them. My favorite shmup idea was a combination of a few from the top five that I brainstormed during my ideation journal.

**Shmup Idea:** A cooperative shoot-em-up where multiple players aim to heal a large ally together to keep it alive against enemy fire and obstacles

**Basic Rules:**
Players must work together and aim to shoot healing projectiles at a large robot ally to keep it alive as it endures enemy fire and other obstacles. The player’s role and projectile must match the area they are healing, or it will not repair the ally. If the ally runs out of health and dies, the game is over.

**Formal Elements:**
* Players: cooperative (multiple players work together with different roles)
* Objective: defend/heal (repairing and protecting an ally)
* Rules: hit box size (made smaller to put focus on precision)
* Conflict: opponents (different healing types, different enemy types; must shoot correct projectile at matching area/enemy)

**Puzzles/Challenges:**
* Each player has a different role or projectile that corresponds to specific area(s) and is only able to heal/repair those areas or damage certain enemies (color matching)
* Hit box sizes on large ally are relatively small, like doing surgery (precision)
