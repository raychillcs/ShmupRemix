# Shmup Remix
A cooperative shoot-em-up where two players aim to heal their main ally together to keep it alive against heavy enemy fire. Each player has the option to shoot damaging or healing projectiles, but be careful: your damage-dealing shots will also hurt your ally. If the ally runs out of health of either of the heroes dies, the game is over.

**Design Goals:**
* Cooperative: multiple players must work together and communicate to keep the ally alive
* Coordination: with different types of projectiles, you must shoot correct projectile at right character
* Survival and defense: protect and repair your ally while staying alive
* Precision: rewarded for good aim and punished for bad aim (friendly fire)
